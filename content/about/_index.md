## Get to know me!
---
Hey! I'm **Rafi**, a **Computer Science** undergraduate student at Universitas
Gadjah Mada, currently in my second year. I'm passionate about **Software Engineering** and
**Cybersecurity**.

I won't go into too much detail on this site since it's mainly for blogging. As for why I created it, there's a saying by **David Allen**, creator of the _Getting Things Done (GTD)_, that goes: 
> "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.‚Äù 

So, if I want to express what's on my mind, why not share it? Maybe it'll be useful to others (hopefully). Anyway, enjoy!
